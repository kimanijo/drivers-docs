## Features

The OpenAstroTech driver extends the LX200 GPS that was previously used driver and adds some extra features:

-   Focusing with relative (instead of time based) movements and backlash compensation.
-   Support for the Auto Polar Alignment extension.
-   Custom "Meade Command" field. Enter a command like ":GVP#" and work with the responses until there's real support for the feature you're missing.

Under development are these items, but if you know the [Meade commands](https://wiki.openastrotech.com/en/Knowledge/Firmware/MeadeCommands) you can use them by just using the "Meade Command" field:

-   RA Homing (you need to have the RA Homing extension installed)
-   DEC Homing
-   DEC Limits

## Operation

Let KStars set the time/date and simply operate like you normally would. More information can be found on the [wiki](https://wiki.openastrotech.com/en/Knowledge/Software).
