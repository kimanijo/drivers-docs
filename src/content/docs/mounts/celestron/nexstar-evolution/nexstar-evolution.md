##   
Features

The Celestron Nextstar supports all GOTO and sky alignment functions of NexStar Evolution telescopes. In principle it should support any Celestron scope using AUX command set (most of them) with SkyFi wireless module. It was never tested with equatorial mount but should in principle work with it using sky alignment framework.

## Operation

The driver auto-detects the scope on the network so the operation should be similar to other telescope drivers. You do not need to set anything in communication setup. Let me know if you have any problems with connections. Serial communication is not implemented yet. It is on the list, but quite low on it.
