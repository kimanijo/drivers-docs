The Telescope-Control-System TCS of ALLUNA Optics has been designed for the remote control of high-quality telescopes. Alluna Optics provides only ASCOM drivers and a Windows EXE program to control the TCS2 Device. The TCS2 can also be controlled by an optional handheld device.

With TCS several telescope functions are controlled and monitored:

-   Air conditioning of the optical tube and the main mirror i.e., primary/secondary mirror heating and ventilation
-   Temperature of ambient (focuser), primary and secondary mirror
-   Focusing on the optics
-   Control of the optionally available CCD Rotator
-   Control of the optionally available robotic Dust Cover
-   Setting configuration parameters
