## Features

The driver supports the Gemini Pulsar 2 and the Pulsar controllers. Basic functions such as Track, Sync, and Park/Unpark are supported as well as enabling/disabling of periodic error correction, pole crossing and refraction correction. This driver is in beta version and is under development to add more features.

## Operation

On connection, the mount sets the controller time and location.

Before syncing the mount make sure that the correct side of the pier is selected in the  **Main Control**  tab.

When using the driver for the first time, ensure to set the telescope's aperture and focal length in the  **Options**  tab.
