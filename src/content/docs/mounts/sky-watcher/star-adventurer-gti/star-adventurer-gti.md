## Connectivity

To ensure proper mount operation and pointing accuracy, connect to mount using either Synscan App OR INDI driver - never both simultaneously. For initial alignment, first perform alignment using Synscan App, then fully disconnect Synscan App before connecting and controlling mount via INDI driver. Running both control systems concurrently will compromise the pointing system and may result in inaccurate GOTO operations.
