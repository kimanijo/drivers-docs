## Operation

The lx200classic and lx200autostar drivers are used for telescope control as well as focus control. You can have a fine control of the focuser by setting the following parameters in the driver:

1.  Focus Direction: in or out with respect to the mirror.
2.  Focus Speed: Halt, Slow, and Fast for lx200classic. 1-4 speed settings for lx200autostar.
3.  Focus Time: The duration of the focus motion in milliseconds before halt.
After setting #2 and #3, press either Focus In or Focus Out and the focuser will move with the desired speed until the timer reaches 0.
