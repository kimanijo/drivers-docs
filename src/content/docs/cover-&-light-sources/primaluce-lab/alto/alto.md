## Features

If you want to automate the capture of your calibration files or if you're searching for the best way to remotely open and close your telescope, you can add the optional ALTO telescope cover motor and use  [GIOTTO](https://stellarmate.com/individuals/devices/covers-light-sources/primaluce-giotto.html)  as a remotely controlled motorized cap! Primaluce designed ALTO to be easily connected with our PLUS clamp to any Vixen or Losmandy style dovetail bar that is already present in many telescopes (like SCT, Aplanatic SCT, RCT, etc).

If your telescope has a short bar (for example in refractors or newtonians) you can easily add a longer dovetail bar to let you clamp ALTO just above or below the front end of your tube! This design allows you to adjust GIOTTO and ALTO positions to allow an optimal opening and closing of your telescope.

## Control

The ALTO controls are very straightforward. You can Park (fully close) or unpark (fully open) the cover. Speed can be set to either slow or fast (default).

## Calibration

The maximum and minimal positions can be calibrated by clicking the  **Start**  calibration button. Set the desired speed then start by moving the cover to its close position by pressing  **Close**. Once ALTO reaches closed position, click  **Stop**. Proceed to move the cover to its open position by pressing  **Open**  and then stop when it reaches the position. Calibration is complete by now and the cover range should respect the calibration limit set.
