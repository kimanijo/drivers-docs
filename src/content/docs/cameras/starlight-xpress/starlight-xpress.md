## Features

The driver supports all Starlight Xpress CCDs, including autoguiders such as Lodestar. You can take exposures, set frame type and dimensions, and control temperature & cooler when applicable. The CCD  **must**  be powered and connected before you run the INDI server.

## Operation

Once you're connected, you can select one or more physically connected camera, set cooler and temperature or control shutter (if applicable) and capture images as FITS.
